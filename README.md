# Example Chimera Project

This is an example Chimera project built on `golang`. It uses every feature in Chimera (v1.0.0), including replica count, reading and writing from channels, exposing ports and adding environment variables. The documentation for the Client and yaml files can be found in the [client's repository](https://www.github.com/insprbr/client-golang).
